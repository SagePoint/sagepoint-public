Suspension of Service and Acceleration.</h4> If any amount owing by You under this or any other agreement for Our services is 30 or more days overdue (or 10 or more days overdue in the case of amounts You have authorized Us to charge to Your credit card), We may, without limiting Our other rights and remedies, accelerate Your unpaid fee obligations under such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Our services to You until such amounts are paid in full.

<h4>6.5. Payment Disputes.</h4> We shall not exercise Our rights under Section 6.3 (Overdue Charges) or 6.4 (Suspension of Service and Acceleration) if the applicable charges are under reasonable and good-faith dispute and You are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.
